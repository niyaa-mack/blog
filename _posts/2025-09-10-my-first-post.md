<p class="">This is the summer where I changed my life around. I had to change my mindset to figuring out what is going to be my future, who I am going to be in a few years, and where am I going after high school. Most of my summer was used to research colleges for the sake of time. I never really thought about what type of college I want to go to and I dont have a lot of time anymore. I want to go out of state because I know if I stay here and do college I am not going to finish it so I made the decision to leave. This summer was not as fun as the others but I mainly hanged out with my family every day and we did multiple activties like go to the pool, go to the park, and have cookouts. My family is very family-oriented so we did everything together. 

My friends and I were very busy this summer so I barely saw any of my friends this summer. One of my favorite memories of this summer would be me having a family day. If my family is bored or something we are going to find something to do like trampoline park, pool party, or a road trip. I had a water fight with a big group of my family and friends on one of the hottest days, it was so much fun. We have so much fun doing anything as a family literally but it is not This is my first blog ever by the way.
