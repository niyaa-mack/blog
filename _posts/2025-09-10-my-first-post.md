<p>This is the summer where I changed my life around. I had to change my mindset by figuring out what is going to be my future, who I am going to be in a few years, and where am I going after high school. Most of my summer was used to research colleges for the sake of time. I never really thought about what type of college I want to go to and I dont have a lot of time anymore.  This is my first blog ever by the way. I mainly hanged out with my family every day and we did multiple activties like go to the pool, go to the park, and have cookouts. My family is a very close family so we did everything together.  </p>
